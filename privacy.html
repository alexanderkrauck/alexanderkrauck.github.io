    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely for providing the services you request. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties except as required to process the data as described above (e.g., using OpenAI's Whisper model for audio processing).</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. OAuth tokens and any other sensitive information are encrypted and stored in secure systems. Only you have access to your LinkedIn data.</p>
